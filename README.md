# Introduction

This is an ongoing pure JavaScript DOM project, a medium difficulty note-taking app that over several iterations should be able to do the following tasks.

# Live Site

# Tasks

- [Persist Data to local Storage](#Persisting_Data)

- [Make use of a JavaScript Library](#Library_Used)

- [Dynamic and responsive UI on different resolutions](#responsiveness)

- [Use moment.js to create time stamped notices](#Library_Used)

- [Use muuri to create sortable grids](#Muuri_Functionality)

# Persisting Data

This functionality has not been added as of this time.

# Library Used

[Luxon](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/luxon) was used to initiate the timestamp property.

# Responsiveness

Media Queries have been used to remove sidebar for lower resolutions.

# Library Used 

Moment.js has been retired and is now a legacy library, Luxon has been used in place of moment.js

# Muuri Functionality 

Muuri library has not been added.

# HowTo

Normally I'd start with a mobile first approach but decided to build/plan the desktop resolutions then remove unneeded items with media queries when scaling down to lower resolutions.

# Updates

Future updates will move functionality to a client-side library like React/Nextjs or Vuejs.
