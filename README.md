# Introduction 
This is an ongoing pure JavaScript DOM project, a medium difficulty note-taking app that over several iterations should be able to do the following tasks.

# Tasks
- [Persist Data to local Storage]()
- [Make use of a JavaScript Framework]()
- [Dynamic and responsive UI on different resolutions]()
- [Use moment.js to create time stamped notices]()
- [Use muuri to create sortable grids]()
- [Experiment with different implementations]()


# HowTo
Normally I'd start with a mobile first approach but decided to build/plan the desktop resolutions then remove unneeded items with media queries when scaling down to lower resolutions.

# Updates
Future updates will move functionality to a client-side library like React/Nextjs or Vuejs.
